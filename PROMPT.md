You should build the full feature, including infrastructure, local changes. You should build it, test it, verify it, and so on. You shouldn't ask the user; you should do all the work and make the needed decisions. Commit. When it works locally fully, you should output an exit signal. Later, the user will test, and then we will commit and work on verified GCP infrastructure.
We do the job in the Ralph loop, and here you are in the one iteration. In this iteration, you should take tasks to implement, or if there are no tasks, you need to decompose or if the tasks are too big, you need to decompose and create more tasks.
Use front-end designer skills when working on UI.
